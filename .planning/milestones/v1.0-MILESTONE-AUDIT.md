## Human Verification Checklist

While all automated checks passed, **19 items require human testing** before production deployment:

### Phase 3: Interactive Components (11 items)

1. **Navbar scroll behavior:** Scroll down hides navbar, scroll up reveals it
2. **Mobile hamburger menu:** Menu opens/closes on screens < 768px
3. **Language switcher:** Clicking ES/EN preserves scroll position
4. **AnnouncementBanner persistence:** Dismiss persists across reloads (localStorage)
5. **TractionBar animation:** Numbers count from 0 to target when scrolled into view
6. **Animation once behavior:** Scrolling past and back doesn't re-trigger animations
7. **Hero mascot float:** Continuous smooth up-down animation
8. **Intent card selection:** Visual feedback (scale, border, form reveal)
9. **Form validation errors:** Inline errors for name < 2 chars or invalid email
10. **Form submission:** Valid submission shows success, creates database row
11. **No hydration errors:** Zero hydration errors in browser console

### Phase 4: SEO & Metadata (8 items)

1. **View /es page source:** Spanish title, description, canonical /es, hreflang alternates
2. **View /en page source:** English title, description, canonical /en, hreflang alternates
3. **JSON-LD verification:** 3 script tags (Organization, Event, FAQPage) in page source
4. **OpenGraph image /es:** 1200x630 PNG with Spanish branding, purple gradient, house colors
5. **OpenGraph image /en:** 1200x630 PNG with English branding, purple gradient, house colors
6. **Sitemap.xml:** Valid XML with /es and /en entries, hreflang alternates
7. **Robots.txt:** Allows all crawlers, links to sitemap
8. **Social sharing preview:** Test with opengraph.xyz or platform debug tool

### Recommended Testing Tools

- **Browser DevTools:** Console for hydration errors, Network tab for analytics calls
- **PostHog Dashboard:** Verify pageview events and Core Web Vitals metrics
- **Google Rich Results Test:** Validate JSON-LD schemas
- **opengraph.xyz:** Test social sharing previews
- **Lighthouse:** Performance audit (target: 90+ score, LCP < 2.5s, INP < 200ms, CLS < 0.1)

## Tech Debt

### Minor Observations (Non-Blocking)

**Count:** 1 item
**Impact:** Low
**Priority:** Optional enhancement

#### 1. Section ID Constants

**Type:** Maintainability
**Location:** src/app/[locale]/_components/Navbar.tsx:29-34

**Current Implementation:**
Navbar hardcodes section IDs as strings:
```typescript
const navLinks = [
  { label: translations.about, target: "houses" },
  { label: translations.programs, target: "programs" },
  // ...
];
```

**Status:** Currently working correctly. All anchor navigation verified.

**Future-Proofing:** Consider extracting section IDs to `src/lib/constants/sections.ts`:
```typescript
export const SECTION_IDS = {
  HOUSES: "houses",
  PROGRAMS: "programs",
  COMMUNITY: "community",
  EVENTS: "events",
  INTENT: "intent-cta",
} as const;
```

**Benefit:** Prevents accidental mismatches if components are refactored.

**Impact if not addressed:** None currently. This is a nice-to-have for long-term maintainability.
