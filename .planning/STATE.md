## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: 5 phases in linear dependency chain, foundation-first to front-load risk
- [Roadmap]: Phase 1 split into 3 plans (init, styling+i18n, data layer) for manageable scope

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- [Research]: next-intl + Next.js 16 proxy.ts integration is new territory -- verify exact config during Phase 1 planning
- [Research]: TanStack Forms + Server Actions integration is POC-level maturity -- may need useActionState fallback in Phase 3
- [Research]: Tailwind v4.1.18 has known Turbopack build failure -- pin to v4.0.7 if hit
- [Research]: @t3-oss/env-nextjs has no explicit Next.js 16 docs yet -- verify during Phase 1
