<objective>
Create llms.txt files for AI system discoverability and implement production readiness states (404, error boundary, loading) with bilingual support.

Purpose: Make the landing page discoverable by AI systems (GEO-02, GEO-03) and handle edge cases gracefully in production (GEO-05) with proper localized error/loading/404 states.
Output: Two static llms.txt files in public/, internationalized error/loading/not-found pages, catch-all route for 404 detection.

    ```

    Create `public/llms-full.txt` — extended version (under 100KB) with additional detail:
    - Same H1 and blockquote as llms.txt
    - Expanded "About" section: mission, vision, community traction (400+ members, 250+ summit attendees, 92+ applicants, 15 fellows)
    - Expanded "Programs" section: full details on pre-incubation (curriculum, mentorship model, demo day format) and fellowship (funding terms, lab access, timeline)
    - Expanded "Events" section: SpecHack full description (spec-first methodology, in-person hubs + virtual track, the antidote to "vibe coding")
    - Expanded "Houses" section: deeper description of each vertical with focus areas and target applications
    - "Community" section: community size, engagement model
    - "FAQ" section: include the 4 FAQ Q&A pairs from the translation files
    - "Partners" section: mention partnership opportunities
    - "Contact" section: full contact info including all social links from seo-config.ts
    - "Technical" section: Brief note that the site is built with Next.js, supports ES/EN, implements JSON-LD structured data

    Use the actual content from seo-config.ts (SITE_URL, CONTACT_EMAIL, SOCIAL_LINKS) and translation files for accuracy. Single source of truth — derive all content from existing translation keys and seo-config.

  <done>llms.txt is under 2KB with H1 + blockquote + H2 sections. llms-full.txt is under 100KB with expanded content. Both use accurate data from seo-config and translations.</done>

  </files>
  <action>
    1. Add translation keys to `messages/en.json` (add at top level alongside "metadata", "faq", "landing"):
    ```json
    "NotFound": {
      "title": "Page Not Found",
      "description": "The page you're looking for doesn't exist or has been moved.",
      "backHome": "Back to Home"
    },
    "Error": {
      "title": "Something went wrong",
      "description": "An unexpected error occurred. Please try again.",
      "retry": "Try Again"
    },
    "Loading": {
      "text": "Loading..."
    }
    ```

    2. Add translation keys to `messages/es.json`:
    ```json
    "NotFound": {
      "title": "Página no encontrada",
      "description": "La página que buscas no existe o ha sido movida.",
      "backHome": "Volver al inicio"
    },
    "Error": {
      "title": "Algo salió mal",
      "description": "Ocurrió un error inesperado. Por favor, intenta de nuevo.",
      "retry": "Intentar de nuevo"
    },
    "Loading": {
      "text": "Cargando..."
    }
    ```

    3. Create `src/app/[locale]/not-found.tsx`:
    - Import useTranslations from "next-intl"
    - Import Link from "next/link"
    - Use `useTranslations("NotFound")` for localized text
    - Style with cyberpunk theme: dark background, purple accent, centered layout
    - Include large "404" visual text, title, description, and link back to "/"
    - Use Tailwind classes matching site design: bg-background, text-foreground, font-display (Orbitron) for the 404 number
    - Include a subtle purple glow effect on the 404 number for brand consistency

    4. Create `src/app/[locale]/error.tsx`:
    - MUST have "use client" directive (Next.js requirement for error boundaries)
    - Import useTranslations from "next-intl"
    - Accept { error, reset } props with proper TypeScript types: `{ error: Error & { digest?: string }; reset: () => void }`
    - Log error to console in useEffect
    - Style consistently with not-found page: centered layout, dark theme
    - Show title, description, and retry button that calls reset()
    - Button styled with primary color (purple gradient)

    5. Create `src/app/[locale]/loading.tsx`:
    - Simple loading spinner centered on screen
    - Use Tailwind animate-spin with purple border
    - Accessible: add sr-only "Loading..." text
    - No "use client" needed (can be Server Component)

    6. Create `src/app/[locale]/[...rest]/page.tsx`:
    - Import notFound from "next/navigation"
    - Simply call notFound() — this triggers the not-found.tsx in parent [locale] segment
    - This catches ALL unknown routes under /es/* and /en/*

    Use tabs for indentation, double quotes for strings (Biome conventions). All styling should match the existing cyberpunk purple theme.
  </action>
  <verify>
    ```bash
    bun run check
    bunx tsc --noEmit
    bun run build 2>&1 | tail -20

    Biome passes, TypeScript compiles, build succeeds. Translation keys exist in both locale files.
  </verify>
  <done>NotFound, Error, and Loading pages render with localized text. Catch-all route triggers 404 for unknown paths. All pages styled consistently with cyberpunk theme. Build passes.</done>
